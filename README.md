A classic introductory project (with forms): A todo list with basic functionality:
* Todo list grows or shrinks dynamically (though user interaction).
* Each todo item can be checked as completed; doing so changes the text red and strikethrough.
* Each todo item can be deleted.
* Todo list persists on refresh of the page.
